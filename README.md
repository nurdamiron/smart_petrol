## Introduction

At many enterprises, the fuel supply process is a challenging area to control. Outdated manual methods of fuel accounting, such as paper waybills and manual report reduction, are prone to errors and inefficiencies. The Smart Filling Station concept aims to address these challenges by automating and digitizing the entire fuel management process.

The system operates through controllers installed at fuel entry and exit points, authenticated by chip keys issued to authorized personnel. A network platform, consisting of a computer program and a web interface, allows remote configuration and control. Level gauges accurately monitor fuel levels before and after each operation, with the data sent to the software platform.

## Key Features

- **Automated Fuel Management:** The system automates the process of receiving, storing, dispensing, and accounting for fuel, eliminating the need for manual paperwork.
- **Chip Key Authentication:** Authorized personnel use chip keys to authenticate themselves at the system's controllers, ensuring secure access to fuel-related actions.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** The system provides real-time visibility into fuel-related activities, including fuel truck arrivals, fuel transfers, and vehicle refueling at gas stations.
- **Accurate Reporting:** Detailed reports on fuel consumption, costs, and trends are generated, providing valuable insights for decision-making and optimization.
- **Integration with Accounting Software:** The system seamlessly integrates with accounting software, such as 1C, for streamlined fuel accounting and financial management.
